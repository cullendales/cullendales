## About Me
I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. Creating programs which optimize aspects of my own life is a passion of mine, and I am continuously working to improve my skillset. I focus primarily on backend development but have recently been exploring frontend development by building my own website and browser extensions.
