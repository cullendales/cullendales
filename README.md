## About Me
I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at Simon Fraser University, specializing in Artificial Intelligence. Creating programs which optimize aspects of my own life is a passion of mine, and I am continuously working to improve my skillset. I focus primarily on backend development but have recently been exploring frontend development by building my own website and browser extensions.

## Projects
I've included a list below of notable projects of mine organized in a convenient fashion. They have been divided into the categories: [Software Projects](#Software-Projects-(Tools-&-Backend)), [Full Stack Projects](#Full-Stack-Projects) and [Games](#Games).

### Software Projects (Tools & Backend)
